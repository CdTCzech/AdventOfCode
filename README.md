# Advent of Code 2015
My solutions of Advent of Code 2015 in C++11/14/17.

Working only in Visual Studio 2015 with Update 1. Not because of Windows specific code, but because of Coroutines (C++17) preview which I'm using.

Currently every solution is in Source.cpp file. Every day have its own namespace and both parts of the every day have its own function in days namespace.

### Third party libraries I'm using:
MD5 library from http://www.zedwood.com/article/cpp-md5-function .

Thanks everyone!
